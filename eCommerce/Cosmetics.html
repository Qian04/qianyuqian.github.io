                <h2>Business Model Key Points</h2>
                
                <h3>Value Proposition</h3>
                <p>Chih Beauty sells cosmetics, supplemented by skin care products and perfumes. The main purpose of Chih Beauty is to make customers who use the brand aware that they are always beautiful and to help them feel confident. In addition, we also provide sales services for high and low consumers, and also provide cosmetic products of different materials for consumers with different skin types.</p>
                
                <h3>Revenue Model</h3>
                <p>Chih Beauty has multiple revenue models at the same time. This allows the brand to maintain profitability for a long time and develop more new products and promotional plans. First is product sales, we earn income by selling several cosmetic products. Second is membership system, only fixed consumption customers can become members. Members can buy items at better prices on Member days, and they can also exchange some items with brands by earning points. Last, we also provide makeup services, hiring professional stylists to dress customers for various types of banquets or ceremonies. This requires the customer to pay extra and make an appointment.</p>
                
                <h3>Market Opportunity</h3>
                <p>Cosmetics target a wide range of people, age and gender are not required, but the majority of consumers are usually between 20 and 40 years old women. Other than women, our brand also reaches the male market with products such as skin care, makeup, and perfume suitable for men. Besides that, compared with traditional cosmetics, natural and organic cosmetics will be more friendly to human skin. It avoids harmful chemicals such as synthetic ingredients and reduces the risk of allergies.</p>

                <h3>Organizational Development</h3>
                <p>What a mature company needs most is employees who can cooperate and perform their own duties. Each necessary process requires a dedicated department.</p>
                <p>The company's departments can be divided into product design, sales, publicity and quality assurance Departments and others. However, these four departments are the most important, they are interlinked to design the products that are beneficial to the brand and customers.</p>

                    <p>To address this issue, we can use product certification technologies such as Quick Response, which will assign each product a unique identity. Users can then use their mobile devices to accurately identify products by scanning the QR code label on the box. Additionally, there is no restriction on the quantity of uses, which makes it easy for consumers to recognise products at any time or location, and product information is clear at a glance.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, we will inform consumers about the dangers of purchasing fake goods and emphasise the importance of purchasing from authorised retailers. Lastly, we can also create a comparison chart between genuine and fake goods on the official website to assist consumers in deciding whether the things they purchase are authentic or not.</p>
