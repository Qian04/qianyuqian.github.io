<br><br><br>
<div class="font1">
To Be Human College (TBHC) was established in September 2020, which is a separate branch 
from Let's Be Human University (LBHU). Due to the wanton spread of Covid19, the first 
batch of students welcomed by our school since its establishment is all online 
classes. Because it is a new school, many students do not believe in our school, 
but it doesn't matter. Our school will prove its strength and strive to carry 
forward our school as soon as possible. Today, our school has 23 lecturers and 
12 staff members responsible for various trivial matters.
Wish our students a happy life, a smooth graduation and a bright future!
<br><br>
Our club was founded in March 2021, and Michael, the first president, applied to 
the club teacher and successfully passed. There are only five members in the first 
group, and 52 in total, which is a great breakthrough.
